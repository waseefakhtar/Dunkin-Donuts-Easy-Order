CSC 113: Computer Programming Semester Project

Introduction:

This report outlines the design and development of a computer software named Dunkin’ Donuts Easy Order. The program was written in C++ to run under the Windows operating system. The design and ensuing program are modular in nature and make maximum use of abstract data types and of software re-use. Particular attention is paid to details of the program from coding to the final product.
 
In order to run the coffeehouse effectively, cost and time saving is essential. The program Dunkin’ Donuts Easy Order shall do just about that. It is a computerized easy order system for customers to quickly give orders through a system to the restaurant and know the total amount instantly and effectively.
